**Description**
The project is composed by only page where is possible to launch the modal popup for insert the odds value to convert.
Is missing the part relative to the managment of the user data to save for the analysis.
Inside the 'conf' dir is present the instruction used for populate the DB.
Thanks to the bootstrap layout grid, the page and the modal popup is full responsive so that is possible to get a good visualization on mobile device.
The data relative to the Odds and stored inside the DB is loaded only at the first opening of the modal.

<li>CDN for images</li>
<li>Loader when we load the data from the DB for the slow connection</li>
